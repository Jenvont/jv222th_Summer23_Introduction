## My first code
This is my code for the week 3 examination

```json

let age = 25
let name = 'Jennifer'
let hometown = 'Norrt√§lje'
let travellist = ['Japan', ' USA', ' and Italy']

console.log(typeof travellist)
console.log(typeof age)
console.log(typeof hometown)

console.log('Hello, I am ' + age + ' years old.')

if (typeof age === 'number'){
  age = 27
  console.log('Hello again, my name is ' + name + ' and I am now ' + age + ' years old, how old are you?')
  console.log('- I am also ' + age + ' years old.')
}

if (typeof hometown === 'string'){
  console.log('I live in ' + hometown + ' but would love to visit ' + travellist + ' someday!')
}

```
I interpreted the requirements that each point needed is a minimum *(for example I have several typeofs)* and that they can be combined.
